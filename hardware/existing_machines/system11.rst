Controlling Williams, Bally System 11 Machines
==============================================

You can connect your machine using the
:doc:`SNUX System 11 board </hardware/snux/index>` to any
:doc:`WPC controller <wpc>`
such as the :doc:`Multimorphic P-ROC </hardware/multimorphic/index>`
(not the P3-ROC).
This solution requires the existing driver boards.

Another option is to use the
:doc:`Arduino Pinball Controller (APC) </hardware/apc/index>`
which also replaces the original driver board.
Nothing except the APC board is needed to control the machine using MPF.
This can be optionally used together with
:doc:`LISY </hardware/lisy/index>` to emulate the original ROM.

More technical information can be found in the
`PinWiki Williams System 9 and 11 <http://www.pinwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Williams_System_9_-_11>`_ page.
